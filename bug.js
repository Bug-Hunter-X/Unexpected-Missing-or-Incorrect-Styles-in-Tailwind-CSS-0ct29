```javascript
// Some code that uses Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Component</h1>
</div>
```

This code might produce unexpected results if the `bg-gray-100` or other classes are not correctly defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`).  A common error is forgetting to include the relevant plugins or having an incorrect configuration that doesn't allow the use of a specific color or utility.  Another uncommon error might be due to incorrect purging, where the compiler removes styles not used in your codebase leading to the absence of the class when building.
