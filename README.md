# Unexpected Missing or Incorrect Styles in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to Tailwind CSS where styles might be missing or incorrect due to issues with the Tailwind configuration, purging, or plugin inclusion.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when expected Tailwind CSS classes don't apply correctly to elements.  This is often caused by:

* **Incorrect Tailwind Configuration:** Missing plugins, incorrect color palettes, or invalid settings in `tailwind.config.js`.
* **Aggressive Purging:**  If the purge option in `tailwind.config.js` is too aggressive, it might unintentionally remove styles that your application needs.
* **Plugin Issues:**  Issues with the specific plugin that might be needed for your custom configurations

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the development server (instructions might vary depending on your setup).
4. Observe the unexpected styling on the UI elements.

## Solution

The solution is often found by carefully reviewing your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure it is configured correctly. Check plugin inclusion, purging settings, and the content of any custom configuration.
