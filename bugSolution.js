```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ], 
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    //Ensure all necessary plugins are included here. If you're using custom colors or components you might need to configure plugins accordingly.
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
  ],
  purge: {
    enabled: true, // Consider disabling for dev environments. Set to false during dev
    content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", ],
  },
};
```

Ensure that the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` accurately reflects where your Tailwind CSS classes are used.  If you use a specific plugin for custom colors or additional styling features, make sure it is included in the `plugins` array. If you're seeing issues in development, consider temporarily disabling `purge` to check if your styles are correctly defined.
